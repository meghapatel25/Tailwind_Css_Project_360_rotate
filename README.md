# Responsive Service Cards with 360Â° Hover Animation Using Tailwind CSS and Anime.js #
This project features a responsive "OUR SERVICES" section with four service cards. Each card displays an icon, service title, description, and a call-to-action link. Using Anime.js, the cards rotate 360 degrees on hover, creating an engaging interaction. The design is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for smooth animations.
# Features #
- Card Layout: Each service card is styled with a clean, modern design. Icons are displayed at the top of each card, followed by the service title, description, and a link to explore the service further.
- Hover Animation: When a user hovers over a service card, the card rotates 360 degrees, providing an engaging interaction effect. The animation is powered by a lightweight JavaScript animation library (Anime.js).
